    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <ul class="faq-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Should I only hire a private investigator who is licensed in the State of California?</strong>
        <p>Yes. California law requires private investigators to hold a valid license issued by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services. Hiring a licensed professional ensures they meet the legal standards necessary to conduct private investigations in the State of California. My private investigator's license number is ######, and it can be verified at <a href="https://search.dca.ca.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search.dca.ca.gov</a>.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>Should a private investigator carry insurance?</strong>
        <p>Yes. Although it’s not required by law, carrying liability and errors & omissions (E&O) insurance is highly recommended. It demonstrates that a private investigator is serious, professional, and financially responsible. I carry both liability and E&O insurance to ensure my clients work with a qualified professional.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>What professional background and areas of specialization should I look for?</strong>
        <p>Look for private investigators with relevant law enforcement, legal, or investigative experience aligned with your specific case type. As a retired police officer with 28 years of service and a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice, I possess the skills, knowledge, and experience to investigate a wide variety of case types.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>Can my investigation be handled outside of regular business hours?</strong>
        <p>Absolutely. Investigative work often requires flexibility beyond a 9–5 schedule. I offer evening, weekend, and on-call availability to meet urgent or unexpected needs.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>How will my confidentiality be protected?</strong>
        <p>All case files, communications, and findings are managed under strict confidentiality. Information will only be shared with you, your authorized designee, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>Who will be responsible for managing and conducting my investigation?</strong>
        <p>I will personally manage and conduct every aspect of your case, and you will have direct access to me throughout the investigation.</p>
      </li>
      
      
      <li>
        <strong>Will you coordinate with my attorney throughout the process?</strong>
        <p>Yes. I will work with your attorney to ensure my investigative strategy supports your overall legal objectives. I will maintain open communication with your attorney, provide timely updates, and tailor the investigation and reporting to meet the specific needs of your case.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>When the investigation concludes, will I receive a report?</strong>
        <p>Yes. Upon conclusion, you will receive a report of your choosing. It can be anywhere from a comprehensive written report, including timelines, findings, and evidence collected, to a simple verbal summary of my findings. Final reports are often dictated by the case type, but can be tailored to your request.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>How can I be sure your methods comply with legal and ethical standards?</strong>
        <p>All investigative activities strictly adhere to California law, BSIS regulations, and professional ethical standards. I will not employ unauthorized or illegal investigative practices.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>If my case goes to court, can you serve as a witness?</strong>
        <p>Yes. I am prepared and experienced in providing courtroom testimony for criminal, civil, and administrative hearings.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>Will there be a written agreement outlining the scope, fees, and terms?</strong>
        <p>Yes. Before any work begins, you will receive a clear, written agreement detailing the scope of services, fee structure, and other conditions.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>Can you guarantee the outcome I’m seeking?</strong>
        <p>No. While I can commit to conducting a thorough and lawful investigation, ethical standards prohibit promising specific results. My role is to uncover objective facts and deliver accurate findings.</p>
      </li>
